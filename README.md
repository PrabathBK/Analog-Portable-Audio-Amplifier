# ðŸ“¢ Portable Audio Amplifier Project

I'm excited to share the 'Portable Audio Amplifier' Project by 'Team Resonance', completed under the Laboratory Practice and Project module in 3rd semester.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Our mission was to design a Portable Audio Amplifier using only analog components. Our device is capable of amplifying audio input from any audio-generating device through three main sub-circuits: preamplifier, tone controller, and power amplifier. By leveraging the Baxandall passive tone-controller, we successfully implemented volume, bass, and treble controls, ensuring optimal audio customization.

## ðŸ”‹ Power & Efficiency
Powered by Li-ion rechargeable batteries, our design prioritizes portability without compromising on performance. We've ensured maximum power efficiency to provide a seamless audio experience on the go.

## â­• Key Features
- âœ… Comprehensive audio amplification through preamplifier, tone controller, and power amplifier circuits
